# Structural-Macroeconometrics
This project was conducted as part of the Structural Macroeconometrics course examination. The objective was to estimate the fiscal multipliers (government spending and tax multipliers) for the U.S. economy using a narrative proxy for tax shocks as an external instrument within a proxy-SVAR framework. Additionally, the analysis incorporated the Classical Minimum Distance (CMD) approach, as proposed by Angelini and Fanelli (2019).
It is worth noting that we unintentionally overlooked the critique by Jentsch and Lunsford (2019) regarding the use of Wild Bootstrap in Martens and Ravn (2013).
The professor assessed the project with a grade of 28/30, deducting one point due to the use of Wild Bootstrap and another point for minor formal inaccuracies.

## Warning
We adapted the code from Martens and Ravn (2014) to fit our dataset; therefore, the code is not entirely our own work.
